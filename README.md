### Data_Visualization_Portfolio
Public portfolio for data visualizations prepared in the classroom and on the job. 

### About Me 
My name is Christian Schoeberl and I am a near-graduate of the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am in the Master's of Science in Public Policy Management - Data Analytics Cohort, which combines computational and mathematical coursework with public policy expertise. My goal is to apply all that I have learned to solve key public interest problems, including policy analysis & impact analysis, financial forecasting, local resiliency and planning, and public interest technology application. 

### What I Hope to Learn 
I have a deep interest in staying up to date on the staples and "newcomers" in the data visualization field. From seaborn to Tableau, I love getting to apply my data analytics skills both in data cleanup & storage, code development, and downstream presentation. Currently, I am hoping to learn how to utilize AR/VR for the purposes of showcasing data analysis.

# Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio, Interactive World Map
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/8565122"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In order to best display the country-by-country differences in debt-to-GDP ratios, I composed an interactive world map on Flourish. By generating shapes for each country, I was able to display each country as they would appear on a map. Furthermore, by stripping the data to the most recent year available (2019), the countries for which data is available are able to be compared. The tool I used also allows the user to scroll in and out, meaning that each user can focus their attention on a particular part of the globe if they desire. The use of a red gradient based on the ratios also highlights the countries with the higheset debt. Given high governmental debt is on the forefront of policy debates not just here in the US but across the globe, thsi graphic allows for easy analysis of all major countries and their respective ratios. 
As more data becomes available, I hope to update the graph. Ideally this graphic will allow users to see trends in their country's debt-to-GDP ratio to stay informed on domestic fiscal policy. This goal is better accomplished with a world map than a grid of lines because it much clearer to the user. I know I would rather find my country on a globe, where the position is familar, than on a grid of ~50 country names/abbreviations.
