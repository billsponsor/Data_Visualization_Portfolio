## Data_Visualization_Portfolio
Public portfolio for data visualizations prepared in the classroom and on the job. 

## About Me 
My name is Christian Schoeberl and I am a near-graduate of the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am in the Master's of Science in Public Policy Management - Data Analytics Cohort, which combines computational and mathematical coursework with public policy expertise. My goal is to apply all that I have learned to solve key public interest problems, including policy analysis & impact analysis, financial forecasting, local resiliency and planning, and public interest technology application. 

## What I Hope to Learn 
I have a deep interest in staying up to date on the staples and "newcomers" in the data visualization field. From seaborn to Tableau, I love getting to apply my data analytics skills both in data cleanup & storage, code development, and downstream presentation. Currently, I am hoping to learn how to utilize AR/VR for the purposes of showcasing data analysis.
