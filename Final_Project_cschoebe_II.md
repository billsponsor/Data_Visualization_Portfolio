# Storyboard 
To draft the first version of my final project, I utilized a storyboard and a moodboard. Following last week's small group critique session, I wanted to make sure I nailed down the exact path my story is going to take. The issue is so broad and affects so many people in so many different ways. It would be impossible to tackle all of them in the 1-hour presentation, much less a 1-minute presentation. To ensure I stay on track with the main elements I want to focus on, I sketched out a story board.

The story board starts with the intended (and wider) audience's foundation - background knowledge, perceptions, feelings, and so on. I kenw it was important to keep their background in mind when devising the rest of the presentation because otherwise I would risk my own background taking over the story. It's always hard for me to keep my presentation audience-facing versus me-facing. After the many hours spent researching this topic and finding various datasets, my own perceptions and attitudes would bias my presentation away from the "ground truth" I'll be facing during the presentation. 

The story board also allowed me to map out my user journey graph into a more concrete outline. The segments I was able to discuss with my critique group are now more detailed and filled out then they were in last week's draft. I was also able to plan out the best presentation order for my various datasets, i.e. which dataset would "hit" the hardest when coupled with a certain narrative. These plans are subject to change, but they at least gave me a relatively solid prototype with which I could conduct user interviews. 

# Moodboard

The moodboard supplemented the insights gained from the story board. The color selection and overall "feel" of the presentation were influenced by the emotions I wanted to capture through the moodboard. 

# User Interview
The most important part of any presentation is the user research. Whether you're presenting a final project for a class or a final product for a client, proper prior vetting is key to success. I have learned that asking questions that are *specific* to the overall format, layout, or flow yet *broad* enough to elicit unfiltered opinions is the best way to get real feedback on your piece. 

I was able to interview 3 individuals for this prototype. 2 were women (mid 20s, late 30s) and 1 was a man (mid 20s). All 3 were college-educated and had heard of the issue beforehand. Given the saliency of this topic, it was hard to find anyone who had no preconceived notions or knowledge on the subject. 
Script: 
  Who do you think the primary audience is for this presentation? 
  Did the graphics make sense? 
  Did the graphics look good? 
  Do you feel the presentation was coherent? Did the flow make sense? 
  Do you feel like this presentation taught you something/gave you insight you didn't have before? 
  What would you like to see added? 
  
Unfortunately, I did not get very helpful feedback on the presentation from my 3 interviews. I think the subject matter made the interviewees more hesitant to say that anything was wrong with the material (maybe to avoid offending me or as a show of support for the topics covered). However, I did receive some key feedback: 
  "The audience seems to be primed at women, but that's not really clear throughout the presentation." 
  "The graph titles are a little boring, they could use some more 'umph' to match the tone." 
  "I would have liked to see more a focus on how to have conversations, rather than it just being tossed in at the end." 
  "The colors were really good, even the background pictures all kind of fit the general color scheme." 
After hearing these comments, I want to go back and revise the titles for all my visualizations. I think framing the information from the perspective of the intended audience would be very helpful in answering a couple of the points above. For example, rather than saying "Men have...," I could say "Of the men in your life, ..." in order to keep it tied to the audience's perspective. I also want to spend some time this week focusing on a possible AR/VR visualization that will assist in conversations. Even if it's not ready for the final presentation, I'd like to eventually be able to have that component.
